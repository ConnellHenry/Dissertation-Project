The video attached alongside this .txt file is the result of 
my year long Dissertation project at the University of
Wolverhampton.

Project Question: How can Rail Industry and visualisation 
		applications be improved through the use 
		of serious games, hand gesture controls 
		and Virtual Reality headsets?

Working alongside the virtual 3D modelling company, Seeable, 
I was able to implement a Leap Motion device to replace and 
improve upon the existing levels of human-computer interaction 
(HCI) used today (such as joysticks, mice and keyboard).

As shown from this demonstration, there are multiple custom-made 
gestures that are used for specific functions (such as zooming 
in or out, toggling text on/off screen etc.), not only showing 
a novel approach to application-based interaction, but also 
expanding the potential implementations for future 
development/consideration.

Due to the existing code developed by Seeable, I am unable to 
upload my development into this project, however, I hope that
the uploaded video and description can provide some insight into
the research I have made.
